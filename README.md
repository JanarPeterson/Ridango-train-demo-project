# Ridango-train-demo-project

**This is a demo project for my Ridango Junior Java Developer job application.**

Spring boot based train REST API is a small train information system that allows users to trigger HTTP request for data processing.

API runs on a Tomcat server port:8080.


## HTTP requests


**GET all trains from the database**

To get all trains from DB trigger a GET request on **URL:** *localhost:8080/trains/* receiving JSON that contains array of train objects.

**GET train by trainID from the database**

For getting specific train information trigger a GET request with a trainID on the end of the regular GET request 
**URL:** *localhost:8080/trains/_trainID_* receiving JSON of a single train object.

###### example

**URL:** *localhost:8080/trains/_28e8ea6f-8f68-4566-b21d-dc30693b73ae_*

**UPDATE trains information in the database**

To update trains use a HTTP PUT request on **URL:** *localhost:8080/trains/*. Method consumes single train object JSON without *route* field which is automaticaly generated by application itself and uses trainID to find correct train, if it exists in a database.

###### example

<img src="https://github.com/JanarPeterson/Ridango-train-demo-project/blob/master/Images/PUT%20example.png" alt="update" width="514" height="115" />


**INSERT new trains into the database**

For inserting new train object into database trigger HTTP POST request on an **URL:** *localhost:8080/trains/* with a body that consumes JSON train object without trainID and route fields, which are both auto-generated. For a successful new train insertion user get's response with a code of 200.

###### example

<img src="https://github.com/JanarPeterson/Ridango-train-demo-project/blob/master/Images/POST%20example.png" alt="insert" width="514" height="120" />

**DELETE trains from the database**
